# MCS-MEMOP-framework

This database contains the data used in the research paper titled “Developing robust management pathways for nutrient pollution management in watersheds under climate uncertainty”. The data included are essential for reproducing the results and analyses presented in the paper.

The data in this repository are organized into the following files:
Figure 4: Data showing the performance of MOP, SMOP, and MEMOP solutions, including the three objectives and four selected solutions.
Figure 5: Data showing the performance of MOP, SMOP, and MEMOP solutions under epoch-specific constraints.
Figure 6: Data showing the unit removal costs of MOP, SMOP, and MEMOP solutions.
Figure 7: Data showing the performance of MEMOP solutions derived from multiple climate scenarios, based on robustness metrics.
Figure 8: Data showing the performance of MCS-MEMOP solutions under new climate conditions.

Each file is in Excel format and contains the data referenced in different sections of the paper. Please refer to the relevant section of the paper for details on how the data were used in the analysis.
